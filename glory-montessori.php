                    Glory Institution’ Nursery School uses the standard EYFS learning programme together with, and in alignment with, features of the Montessori philosophy. It is primarily child-centred and aims to provide a stimulating environment in which children can and want to learn, often by exploration, as soon as they are ready. We cover the seven areas of learning and use regular observation and assessments to plan effectively for individual needs, including those children who may need extra support. We aim for a good balance between adult-led and child-initiated activities, and strive to provide classrooms which are well organised, with clearly defined areas, including good resources with attractive displays.

                    Glory Institution Nursery and Reception classes service individual children’s personal development and academic progress and with this in mind, we deliver separately to those children whose birth dates fall slightly outside the Reception starting age. The intention is that from the very beginning, children’s particular needs personally and academically are addressed effectively. Glory Institution has developed separate classrooms accordingly whilst maintaining the regulatory ratios of staff to children needed and to ensure high contact time between teachers and children.
